# WP Plugin Core

## What's this?

The **WP Plugin Core** library provides base classes for developing WordPress plugins. It enables you to easily build your stuff in a object-oriented way.

## Can I use it?

This library is supposed to be used with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). You can integrate it in your standard WordPress installation though (by copying the sources to your own WP plugin and manually configuring an autoloader etc.). But for ease of use it's recommended to use Composer.

Since [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) supports `composer` it's a perfect match. Using Bedrock isn't a bad choice at all.

## May I use it?

Of course, you may. This library is licensed under the terms of the **MIT license**. See also the project's [license file](./LICENSE.md).

## Let's use it!

### Add dependency using `composer`

Alright, to setup this lib for your project just invoke the following command on terminal:

```bash
# assuming you're in the project's root directory
# (this is where your composer.json is located)
composer require vierbeuter/wp-plugin-core @dev
```

### Implement your custom plugin
